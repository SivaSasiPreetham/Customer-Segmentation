**The HR department at Salifort Motors seeks to employee retention, that is they want to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.**

*Assuming the role of Data Professional, my part is to give Data Driven Suggestions after the process of **Clustering Analysis**. Starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , down the line I chose **Cosine Function of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)** and **K-Means Clustering** to peform Customer Segmentation on Customer Transaction Dataset to give insights on customer purchasing behaviour in a particular supplier. This is done only after experimenting with **Pair Plot** and **Principal Component Analysis**.*
